# How to run the bot?

If you do not have node.js installed you can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org).

First of all you need to install the required packages.
- Run `npm init` in your terminal.
- Run `npm install` in your terminal.

And you can run the bot with the commands below.
- `node .` to run the bot without deploying the commands.
- `npm run deploy` to deploy the commands and run the bot

# Do not forget
Put your bot token and client id (this is the same thing as the bot user id) in the **config.json** file.
